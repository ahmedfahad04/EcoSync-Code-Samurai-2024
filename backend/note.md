We should not create a permission "ALL" that will be assigned to the System Admin in EcoSync.  Here's why:

Security Risk: Granting "ALL" permissions removes granular control and creates a security vulnerability. If a System Admin account gets compromised, a malicious actor could have unrestricted access to modify or delete critical data.

Best Practices: The principle of least privilege suggests giving users only the permissions they need to perform their tasks. This minimizes potential damage if a security breach occurs.

Here's a better approach for EcoSync's System Admin permissions:

Define Specific Permissions:  Identify all actions a System Admin can perform within the application (create/update/delete users, manage roles, access specific data). Create individual permissions for each action.

Assign Granular Permissions:  Assign the required permissions to the System Admin role. This ensures they have the necessary control while limiting access to sensitive areas.

Review Permissions Regularly: Regularly review and update System Admin permissions to reflect any changes in functionality or security requirements.

By following these recommendations, you can create a more secure and manageable permission structure for EcoSync.
